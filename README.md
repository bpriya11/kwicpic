I have added two files.
The first file is the Emotion Detection model using Face Recognition. 
In this model i have used  6 layered Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in Keras and used image augmentations to improve model performance. The accuracy of the model can be improved by increasing the convolutional layers and increasing the number of epochs while training.

In the second file is for uploading a selfie to S3 bucket.
