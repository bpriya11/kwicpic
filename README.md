I have added two files.
The first file is the Emotion Detection model using Face Recognition. 
In this model i have used  6 layered Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in Keras.
The accuracy of the model can be improved by 
1. increasing the convolutional layers.
2. increasing the number of epochs while training.
3. using image augmentation parameters 

In the second file is for uploading a selfie to S3 bucket.
