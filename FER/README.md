This is the Emotion Detection model using Face Recognition. 
In this model i have used 6 layered Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in Keras. I have saved the model as "model_2.h5".
The accuracy of the model can be improved by

1. increasing the convolutional layers.
2. increasing the number of epochs while training.
3. using image augmentation parameters.
